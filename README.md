## Lab 12: Morse Code

## Part 1 - Make a Sound

- Create a file `play_sound.py`. 
- Gather a USB speaker from the shelf(please return after every class so both classes have enough speakers!).
- Install the `playsound` library using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/playsound/). Use the library to play an `.mp3` file using Python. You can use the provided files or download your own for this step.
- Add a digital button or touch sensor to trigger your `.mp3` file.

## Part 2 - Morse Code

- Create a file `play_morse.py`.
- Download the `morseshort.mp3` and `morselong.mp3` files. Use these files to play a message in Morse code using your speaker. Reference the [Morse Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) to help you.

## Part 3 - Translate to Morse Code

- Create a file `translate_morse.py`.
- Write a program to take user input and playback their message in Morse code. 
- *Challenge(Optional): replace common phrases for their  [common abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code_abbreviations) before translating. You can use a data structure like a dictionary for this or read the information from a CSV file for a little more of a challenge.*
- Take a video of your program.

## Rubric 

_Course Content_

- 6 points - All required items are present.    
- 5 points - Task was completed, but supplementary materials are weak or missing.    
    - Code is complete, but poorly communicates necessary information
    -  Solution is correct but is significantly difficult to read, highly inefficient, very clumsy, very difficult to extend etc. From the original Jargon File, we would refer to solutions like this as *kluge*.

    - Used deductive reasoning guide solution.  
    - Reflection on own work was thoughtful and honest.  
- 3 points - Practiced WFR standards  
    - Language is readable but not professional.
